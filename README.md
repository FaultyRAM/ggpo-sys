ggpo-sys is a Rust library that provides raw, unsafe bindings to [GGPO](https://ggpo.net), a library
for rollback networking.

## Requirements

ggpo-sys depends on the following tools at build time:

* A recent version of stable Rust ðŸ¦€
* A C++ toolchain, in order to build the GGPO sources
    * ggpo-sys uses [cc](https://github.com/alexcrichton/cc-rs) to build GGPO. CMake is *not*
      required.
    * 32-bit targets are untested and unsupported. **Use at your own risk.**
    * GGPO only builds under Visual C++ and only for Windows targets. Support for other toolchains
      is therefore blocked pending fixes to upstream.
* libclang
    * Used for generating bindings to ggponet.h.

## Usage

To use ggpo-sys, simply add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ggpo-sys = "^0.1.0"
```

For more details, refer to the source comments in [ggponet.h](libggpo/src/include/ggponet.h).
